Source code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. 
SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors.
 SCM is also synonymous with Version control.
 How does SCM work? 
Tracks code versions
Reverts code to a previous state
Compares changes over time
Allows developers to see a complete history of all changes made to a shared codebase
SCM tools:
Git: A popular SCM tool used by programmers and developers to manage code 
Apache Subversion: Helps software developers create and control multiple versions of directories 
GitLab: A comprehensive solution for source code management 
Mercurial: Supports collaborative development of software within a team 
AWS CodeCommit: A fully managed source control solution that helps manage and store assets such as codes, papers, and other file types 
Core Concepts:
Repository:
A repository (or repo) is a folder or directory that contains all the files and the complete history of changes for a project. 
Branch:
A branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository, allowing you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. 
Commit:
A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in a repository at a specific point in time, representing a version of the project. 
Remote:
A remote repository is a secondary copy of a Git repository, often hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab, used for collaboration and backup. 
Clone:
Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine, allowing you to work with the project files. 
Pull:
Pulling updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository, incorporating the latest code and commits. 
Push:
Pushing uploads your local changes (commits) to a remote repository, making them available to others. 
Merge:
Merging combines changes from one branch into another, integrating the work done on separate branches into a single codebase. 
Fork:
Forking creates a copy of a repository on a remote platform (like GitHub) allowing you to make changes and contribute to the original project. 
Pull Request:
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository, allowing others to review and merge your code into the main branch. 

This is change to test the local changes after making authentication resolved.
